# Spell.Bing.API
The Spell Check API returns a list of words it does not recognize along with suggested replacements. Typically, you would submit text to this API and then either make the suggested replacements in the text or show them to the user of your application so they can decide whether to make the replacements Exemple   text "Hollo, wrld!" The suggested replacements are "Hello" and "world."
